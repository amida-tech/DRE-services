=========

## This version of DRE-services is based on [DRE commit # 09f23c3772af2444c16d03454e20f6e19f7fd512](https://github.com/amida-tech/DRE/commit/09f23c3772af2444c16d03454e20f6e19f7fd512)

DRE is a patient frontend (UI) and Node.js server for reconciling health data.

High Level Overview
===================
![DRE High Level Diagram](docs/images/dre_overview_new.png)

The purpose of the Data Reconciliation Engine is to take personal health data in a variety of formats (starting with BlueButton/CCDA) from multiple sources and parse/normalize/de-duplicate/merge it into a single Patient's Master Health Record with patient assistance (although most of hard work will be done automagically).


DRE's components
=================
![DRE Components Diagram](docs/images/dre_four_components.png)

DRE has 4 primary elements

#### 1 - Parsing and Normalization Library.

This parses incoming data into a homogenous, simplified and normalized data model in JSON format.

Parsing library code: [amida-tech/blue-button](https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button)


#### 2 - Matching Library.

This takes the standardized data elements and flags probable duplicate values. New patient records are compared against the existing Master Health Record and automatically matched. The result produces a list of all entries in the new record, labelled as duplicates (0 % match), new entries (100% match), or partial matches (to be reconciled by patient in a next step).

Matching library code: [amida-tech/blue-button-match](https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button-match)

#### 3 - Reconciliation Interface.

This provides a RESTful API and UI for review and evaluation of duplicate or partially matched entries, by the patient.

#### 4 - Master Record Interface.

This provides a API for interaction with and access to the aggregated health record.

##Quick up and running guide

###Prerequisites

- Node.js (v0.10+) and NPM
- Grunt.js
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Ruby/Compass/Bower

#### prepare
```
# you need Node.js and Grunt.js installed
# and MongoDB + Redis runnning

npm install -g bower
gem update --system
gem install compass
npm install -g yo
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g generator-angular

#then
npm install
bower install
```

To run, use `node server`

#### Grunt commands:

`grunt` - To run Server Side tests

`grunt test` - To run and watch Client Side tests. Make sure a Selenium server and Node are running with `webdriver-manager start` and `node server.js`.

`grunt travis-protractor` - To run Client Side tests. Make sure a Selenium server and Node are running with `webdriver-manager start` and `node server.js`.

```grunt build``` - Executes build and puts it into /dist.

```grunt live``` - Build and watch files for development (just linting, compiling styles and watching).

#### Protractor Tests:

```
# you need MongoDB, Redis, Node, and Selenium running
# option selects which suite of tests to run (populate, scenarios, and/or medications)
# screenshots and report are saved to ./protractor-result/
